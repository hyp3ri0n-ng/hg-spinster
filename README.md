# What is this?

This is a collection of terminal "loading" type stuff. Don't let your user get bored! Use a spinny thing that can entertain for HOURS while you load your shitty code to memory!

# Why

I really didn't feel like working one day.

# For who(m) is this?

Uhh, I guess mostly for like, people. People like me that suck at GUIs so write terminal stuff instead.

# Ok?

What? Is there a problem?! You don't like spinners or something???????

# No no man, just put the knife....
